Also known as Accra Beach, this very popular south coast beach offers a combination of **exciting waves** and **calm swimming**.

The southern end of the beach is perfect for smaller children, as there is a pool-like area protected by rocks that break the force of the waves. For older children the thrill of **boogie boarding** on the crested waves awaits!

Relax on a chaise lounge or on the soft white sand, under the shade of a casuarina or sea-grape tree, or enjoy one of the many watersports activities that are available from the beach such as windsurfing, Hobie Cat rides and body surfing.

Browse the colourful kiosks for tropical clothing & local jewellery and handicraft. Or head to the small restaurant kiosks for a refreshing Banks Beer or tasty fishcakes, a Bajan specialty! For a great lunch and wonderful rum cocktails stroll to **Tiki Bar** at the southern end of the beach.

Or hop across the road to **[Quayside Centre](https://barbados.org/quayside-centre-barbados.htm)** for a great lunch (grilled fish, Chinese, pizza, pasta, ice cream) and to shop for local craft, giftware and beachwear.

Rockley Beach is also a popular hang out spot for viewing amazing colorful **sunsets**!

Stunning sunset!

The **[south coast boardwalk](https://barbados.org/boardwalk/boardwalk3.html)** ends (or begins depending on your perspective!) at Accra beach. It's a wonderful way to see the coastline and enjoy the ocean breezes.
