![Bathsheba / Cattlewash - Labyrinth](/static/images/bathsheba-cattlewash-labyrinth-lowdef.jpg)

We did a labyrinth workshop...mine came out perfect...first try...amazing...jae happened to be there the morning and was up on that big rock in bathsheba/cattlewash and I shouted him take a picture...and he captured it.

My left right brain was so harmonised in those times...doubt I cud make one again so excellent
