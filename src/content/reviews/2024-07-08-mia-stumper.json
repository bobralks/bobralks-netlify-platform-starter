  "text": "I had the privilege of staying at this wonderful homestay for six weeks when I first arrived in Barbados, and I couldn't have asked for a better introduction to the island. Laura welcomed me with hospitality, she made sure my stay was comfortable, and gave me some great tips for the best places to visit and to experience the true essence of the island.  The accommodation was cozy and relaxing. I had my first week in the studio and then had the cottage for my remaining time. Both rooms were spacious, clean, and had all the amenities I needed. Plus the hammock hanging on the terrace, made a great hang out spot in the evening sun.  The location is ideal as it is close enough to the coastal road, which has buses going both South and West of the Island. I was commuting into work, so being close to the main bus route was great. The accommodation is also nicely situated near the beach and a 10 minute walk to the supermarket and Oistins Fish Fry.  I really recommend this homestay to solo travellers like me. It is lovely to have a welcoming place to come home to and I am excited to return!",
