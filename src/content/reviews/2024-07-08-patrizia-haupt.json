  "text": "I stayed in the Cottage for a week and It felt like home right from the beginning. It is located in a quiet area, but close enough to Oistins and the beaches to walk and buses stop around the corner. LauraLin and Tej are very warm, friendly people who can give you tips about anything on the island, very easy to talk to. If you want to learn how to surf or improve your skills you should definitly take a lesson with their neighbour Bodi. The dogs are very cute and hummingbirds came by when I had my morning coffee on the porch. Thanks for the best welcome to Barbados!",
