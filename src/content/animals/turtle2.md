I’m fairly laid back, adaptable. social conscience, semi-vegetarian/aquatarian… trying to develop greater environmental awareness and green practices. embrace a buddhist view, so learning to have a peaceful mind and live without harming other living beings. social. enjoy good humour, genuinity…dislike self importance and aggression. Other to managing our home properties -the cottage and studio - i am a freelance feature writer. holistic practitioner - massage therapist and energy healer. i sometimes paint. sometimes make stuff. sometimes act…sometimes make films…well one short film. started chi qong. wish i could travel more…especially to india and asia. I have 2 sons, a grandson and 4 dogs.
